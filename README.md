# CSE Clinic Presentations Repository 🎓

Welcome to the CSE Clinic Presentations repository! This is a public knowledge-sharing initiative where resources from CSE Clinic sessions are made available for everyone to learn and benefit from.

## 📋 About This Repository

This repository contains presentations, resources, and materials from CSE (Customer Success Engineering) Clinic sessions. Each episode's content is organized into dedicated folders with all the supporting materials, code samples, and documentation needed to understand and implement the concepts discussed.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Make CSE Clinic session content publicly available
- **Community Learning**: Enable developers and engineers to access practical insights
- **Resource Hub**: Centralized location for all presentation materials and supporting content
